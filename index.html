      <h3>Task 1. Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        For this task, we need to finish the function rasterize_triangle() by
        implementing the sampling methods introduced in class. For this
        function, we are given 3 points that form a triangle, so the first step
        I did to increase the efficieny is that using the built in min, and max
        C++ funtions to determine a bounding box of all the sample that I need
        to work with. After that, I have a nested for loops that check whether
        each sample in the bounding box are in the triangle or not using the
        point-in-triangle tests that is introduced in class. Over here, we need
        to address one problem as the spec mentions. we should draw the triangle
        regardless of the winding order of the verticies of the triangle. For
        the point-in-triangle tests, the winding order matter which it could be
        clock-wise or counterclock-wise. In order to address the issue, we can
        check whether the L0, L1, and L2 that we computed are all the same sign
        or not. If L0, L1, L2 are all positive or all negative, then the point
        is inside the triangle. Note that since we want to draw the boundary of
        the triangles as well, we should use lesss than or equals to 0 (<= 0)
        and greater than or equals to 0 (>= 0).

      <p class="introduction">
        As we can see, there are some jaggies here around sharp angle of the red
        triangle, and it is clearer using the pixel inspector. We can also
        preceive the same issue with the pink triangle as well. We will solve
        the issue in the next task using supersampling.
