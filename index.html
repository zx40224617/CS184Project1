      <h2 class="title">Overview of the project:</h2>
      <p class="introduction">
        In this project, we are going through several basic techniques that we
        need for raasterization like sampling, interpolation, and texture
        mapping. In the first 2 tasks, we are going to implement triangle
        rasterization with anti-aliasing techniques for better quality by using
        point-in-triangle test and supersampling. In task 3, we are going to
        play with the basic 2D transformation with a cubeman. In task 4, we are
        implementing a interpolation techniques called barycentric coordinates
        that can help us to interpolate the color in a triangle smoothly. For
        task 5 and 6, we are going to implement texture sampling and level
        sampling, we implement texture sampling for texture sampling to
        interpolate from pixel space to screen space, and we use level sampling
        to help with aliasing issue in order to enhance the performance of
        rendering. Bascially, we walk through a part of the rasterization
        pipeline in this project with implementing different techniques required
        in different tasks. Which gives a really solid basis for undestanding
        how rasterization works in general.
      </p>
      <h3>Task 1. Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        For this task, we need to finish the function rasterize_triangle() by
        implementing the sampling methods introduced in class. For this
        function, we are given 3 points that form a triangle, so the first step
        I did to increase the efficieny is that using the built in min, and max
        C++ funtions to determine a bounding box of all the sample that I need
        to work with. After that, I have a nested for loops that check whether
        each sample in the bounding box are in the triangle or not using the
        point-in-triangle tests (3 line tests) that is introduced in class. Over
        here, we need to address one problem as the spec mentions. we should
        draw the triangle regardless of the winding order of the verticies of
        the triangle. For the 3 line tests, the winding order matter which it
        could be clock-wise or counterclock-wise. In order to address the issue,
        we can check whether the L0, L1, and L2 that we computed are all the
        same sign or not. If L0, L1, L2 are all positive or all negative, then
        the point is inside the triangle. Note that since we want to draw the
        boundary of the triangles as well, we should use lesss than or equals to
        (<=) and greater than or equals to (>=). Note that since there may have
        some floating-point rounding errors that has a really small number
        instead of 0, instead of thresholding at 0, I introduce a little slack
        variable to adjust the issue. At last, if the pixel is in the triangle,
        we call the method fill_pixel() to fill the pixel with specified color.
      </p>

      <p class="introduction">
        As we can see, there are some jaggies here around sharp angle of the red
        triangle, and it is clearer using the pixel inspector. We can also
        preceive the same issue with the pink triangle as well. We will solve
        the issue in the next task using supersampling.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 2. Antialiasing by Supersampling</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        As we discovered in the previous part where the skinny triangle corners
        like the red and pink triangles are having some aliasing issues. In this
        part, we are going to implement supersampling to deal with the issue.
        The idea of supersampling is easy, we bascially sample mutiple locations
        in a single pixel and average the all the sampling pixel values into 1
        final pixel value for rasterization. The reason why supersampling helps
        to deal with aliasing is because for the pixels where it is only
        partially in the triangles, like edges and corners, we still have some
        lighter color for it to smooth them out. In my implementation, I built
        on the code in the previous task, we are using the same bounding box
        method for better efficiency. But over here, instead of 2 nested for
        loops, I have 4 nested for loosp where the outer 2 for loops are for
        each each pixel like in the previous part, and the inner 2 for loops are
        for sampling the multiple locations in each pixel. The step size and the
        upper bound for the inner loops are all depend on the sampling rate.
        After we get the correct locations in the loop, we use the same
        point-in-triangle tests as in the previous task to see whethe the
        location is in the triangle or not. And here comes the trickest part of
        the task, since each locations is not an entire pixel, we can't just
        call fill_pixel() to fill the pixel like in previous task. Over here, we
        use the sample_buffer that is provided in the starter code, which is a
        vector of Color class. This vector have all the colors for each sample
        locations, so we need to update some other functions like
        set_sample_rate() to adjust to the new length of sample_buffer with
        different sample rate. If the sample location is in the triangle, we set
        the sample_buffer at index that is calculated using all 4 loop values
        and sample rate with the specified color. And for rasterization, we
        modify the resolve_to_framebuffer() function by adding all the colors in
        each pixel using a for loop and devided it by sample rate to get a
        average final color for each pixel.

          <img src="images/task2 p = 16.png" class="resultImage" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="introduction">
        As we can see in the above comparison of different supersample rate, as
        the rate increase, the effect of antialiasing will get stronger. In the
        pixel inspector, the lighter red pixels around the sharp corners of the
        red triangle are making it more smooth instead of all breaking apart
        like in case where supersample rate = 1. And we can also see from the
        big picture that all the sharp corners in picture are smoother with
        higher supersample rate. This is because by using supersampling, we 
        allow some pixel that are not entirely in the triangle to have some lighter 
        color that can make the edges and corners a lot smpoother instead of just totally 
        blank and seems to be cutoff.

      <h3>Task 3. Transforms</h3>

      <p class="introduction">
        This part is pretty simple conceptually. What we did was just implement
        the translate(), scale(), and rotate() functions the same way as
        mentioned on the lecture slides. The main idea is just want to get us
        used to the simple 2D transformations that we can perform by making the
        cubeman to do some interesting stuff with the transformation.

      <img src="images/task3 salute.png" class="noteImage" />

      <p class="introduction">
        As you can see, just by using simple transformation, we can make the
        cubeman to dance and salute, and there are more and more other
        possibilites.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 4. Barycentric coordinates</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        For this task, we are implementing a interpolation method called
        barycentric coordinates. Based on the realative location inside the
        triangle to the 3 vertices that defined the triangle, we can compute the
        value at the location base on the value of the 3 vertices. For example,
        look at the following triangle.
      </p>
      <p class="imgTitle">
        Triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex
      </p>
      <img src="images/task4 triangle.png" class="noteImage" />

      <p class="introduction">
        The 3 vertex of the triangle are red, green, and blue. And all the
        colors in the triangle are calculated based on its realtaive position to
        the 3 verticies. We first compute 3 coefficient (\( \alpha \, \beta\,
        \gamma\)) based on the position of the current location and the
        locations of the 3 verticies. We then use the 3 coefficients to get the
        value that we want, which is pixel value in our case. As we can see, the
        transition between colors are really smooth. Also, not just colors,
        Barycentric Coordinates can also works on something like texture and
        normal vectors.

      <h3>Task 5. “Pixel sampling” for texture mapping</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        The reason why we need to do pixel sampling is because that the ratio of
        texture space and screen space may not be the same, so we can't just
        take the pixels in teaxture space and put it right onto the
        corresponding location in screen space directly, we need some kind of
        interpolation. And in this task, we are implementing 2 different pixel
        sampling techniques, which are nearest and bilinear. The nearest method
        is quite literal, we just acquire the texture value that is closest to
        the calculated uv coordinate in the texture space. Where as bilinear is
        a little bit more complicated. Like nearest sampling, we also have a
        calculated uv corrdinates. But this time, we get the 4 closest pixel
        value, and we "lerp" the 4 pixel values together using lerp_color()
        function into 1 color for rendering. So, the most important task here
        comes to how can we calculate the correct uv coordinates in the texture
        space. We use the same 4 nested for loops from supersampling in task 2
        to loop over all the positions. And for each position, we use
        barycentric coordinates to check whether the point is in the triangle or
        not. If it is in the triangle, we calculate the uv coordinates using the
        \( \alpha \, \beta\, \gamma\) coefficients with the given u, v values.
        And we now get the pixel value that we need for rendering from one of
        the specified sampling method. we assign the color to the correct index
        in sample_buffer like in task 2.

        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="introduction">
        As we can see, the bilinear method makes the picture a lot smoother, especially when  
        we look up closely at the alphabet
        "B" in the pixel inspector. but notice that, when we are using higher supersampling 
        rate, the difference bewteen nearest and bilinear method are samller than in the 
        case of lower supersampling rate. This is bascially because high supersampling 
        rate already provides strong antialiasing effect, so the addition of the bilinear 
        method can't make too much of the difference than the nearest method compare to the case  of using a lower 
        supersampling rate. 
      </p>

      <h3>Task 6. Mipmaps for varying resolution texture mapping</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        In this section, we implement level sampling, where we choose the
        resolution of the texture map to use based on the base 2 logarithm of
        the jacobian of the homography that carries the points from the image
        triangle mesh to the texture triangle mesh. We compute this jacobian
        approximately by taking the max of the norms of two standard basis
        vectors under the map.

      <h4>Comparison between all sampling techniques</h4>
      <p class = "introduction">
        we have already explored pixel sampling, level sampling, and supersampling 
        in this HW. There are some advantages and disadvantages of using each of them. 
        Supersampling is conceptually the easiest, and the antialiasing power is 
        amazing, but it requires a lot more cost which cause it to run slowly since 
        it need to compute and look up a lot more locations that 2 other methods. For 
        level sampling, although it taks more memory usage since it needs to pre compute 
        severl levels and store it, but it doens't need to compute again eveytime when rendering,
        which is more cost-effective than super sampling and also provides powerful 
        antialiasing effect. At last, for pixel sampling, as we can see from previous part, 
        nearest method can do really limited antialiasing effect by itself even though 
        it doesn't require too much of memory and can be computed really fast. On the other hand
        bilinear method can provide a really strong antialiasing effect with a little more 
        computation. And as we can see, by combining these techniques together, we can provide a 
        even stronger antialiasing effect.
